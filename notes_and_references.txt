Hypothesis Testing Mind Map (Text Version)
Here is a clear, structured textual mind map summarizing hypothesis testing concepts, the main types of tests, and their associated assumptions. This outline mimics a visual mind map using bullet points and indentation for clarity.

Hypothesis Testing
Purpose: Decide if evidence from a sample supports a specific claim about a population.

1. Key Concepts
Null Hypothesis (H₀): No effect/difference.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is an effect/difference.

Significance Level (α): Probability threshold, e.g., 0.05.

P-Value: Evidence strength against H₀.

2. Types of Hypothesis Tests
Parametric Tests

Assumptions:

Data is normally distributed

Homogeneity of variance

Interval/ratio scale data

Examples:

t-test (2 groups)

ANOVA (3+ groups)

Pearson correlation

Non-Parametric Tests

Assumptions:

No specific distribution required

For ordinal, skewed, or categorical data

Examples:

Mann-Whitney U (2 groups)

Kruskal-Wallis (3+ groups)

Wilcoxon Signed-Rank (paired)

Chi-square (categorical data)

Spearman correlation

3. Decision Path for Choosing a Test
Data Type:

Numerical, categorical, or ordinal?

Number of Groups:

2 groups → t-test or Mann-Whitney U

3+ groups → ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis

Assumptions Met?

Check normality and variance for parametric tests

Use non-parametric if assumptions not met

4. Associated Assumptions
Normality: Data in each group should be approximately normal (for parametric).

Equal Variance: Variances should be similar across groups (Levene/Bartlett test).

Independence: Data points should be independent of each other.

5. Typical Steps
Formulate null and alternative hypotheses.

Choose the correct statistical test.

Check test assumptions (normality, equal variance).

Calculate test statistic and p-value.

Compare p-value to α to accept or reject H₀.

Interpret the result in context.

This structured outline captures the essence of a mind map and can be easily used for quick review or interview preparation related to hypothesis testing and its core assumptions. If you would like a graphic mind map as an image, please let me know!
